Quick Start mentions /fundingsources/program but links to wrong page

In the Quick Start Guide under "Create a program funding source" (https://www.marqeta.com/docs/developer-guides/core-api-quick-start#_create_a_program_funding_source) it mentions an api "/fundingsources/program" with a link to Account Holder Funding Sources (https://www.marqeta.com/docs/core-api/account-holder-funding-sources), however there is no API matching /fundingsources/program there.  Instead, the link should point to Program Funding Sources (https://www.marqeta.com/docs/core-api/program-funding-sources)

Creating card with show_cvv_number and show_pan set to true doesn't set fulfillment state to DIGITALLY_PRESENTED

https://www.marqeta.com/docs/core-api/cards#_query_parameters
You can use optional query parameters to show the PAN and CVV2 number in the response. If show_pan and show_cvv_number are set to true, the fulfillment state of the card is DIGITALLY_PRESENTED instead of the normal initial state of ISSUED; this fulfillment state does not affect the delivery of physical cards.  

Based on the text above, I have created a card with both those values set to true.  I can see in the response, that I am seeing the full values of pan and cvv_number, however fulfillment state is still showing as ISSUED, and not DIGITALLY_PRESENTED.

I'm assuming there is something I'm missing, but there's always the possibility of a bug (either doc, or code), so I figured I'd ask.  

Repro with curl below:

curl --location --request POST 'https://sandbox-api.marqeta.com/v3/cards?show_cvv_number=true&show_pan=true' \
